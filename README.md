# Causes

This repository contains R code and data associated with the final results, supporting the article <b>"Comparing analytical protocols for identifying causes of population changes"</b>. The main goal of this article was to use virtual species to compare different methods, such as time series, species distribution models and process-oriented models, in terms of their ability to diagnose the causes of population changes. 

The study is supported by the National Science Centre, Poland (grant no. 2018/29/B/NZ8/00066) and the Pozna≈Ñ Supercomputing and Networking Centre (grant no. pl0090-01).
